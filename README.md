# php-simple-imageboard


version 1- Quite remarkable for 187 lines of code in one file. Makes the db for you if its not there. Reply to a post by clicking on the post title. It needs a link back to the main board from the reply mode and some sort of pagination - this is meant as a starter kit so you can take the code and make it anything you want. Super easy to feed to Ai and have it finish the board in any style you want !!
