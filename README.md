# php-simple-imageboard


For years, on github, people have been posting horrid php imageboards that were not complete, bloated, and bad looking. Well, now that Ai is here, decent php imageboards can be made in the blink of an eye. 

version 1- Quite remarkable for 187 lines of code in one file. Just run index.php.   Makes the sqlite3 db for you if its not there. Reply to a post by clicking on the post title. It needs a link back to the main board from the reply mode and some sort of pagination - this is meant as a starter kit so you can take the code and make it anything you want. Super easy to feed to Ai and have it finish the board in any style you want !! 

version2- Pagination and link back to board from reply mode added.
